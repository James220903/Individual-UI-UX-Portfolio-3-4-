## Implementation Techniques

For the front end:
- React.js used for building user interface components.
- State managed via React Hooks and Context API.
- CSS/SASS for responsive design.

For the back end (Note: backend is simulated using dummy data):
- Node.js with Express.js for server setup (not fully implemented).
- MongoDB schema designs included for future database integration.
